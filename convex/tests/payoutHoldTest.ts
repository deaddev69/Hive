 * Covers the money-critical rules:
 *   - Final Sale releases at delivery, returns-accepted holds for 24h
 *   - a settled payout is never reopened
 *   - an active return/exchange hold outranks the delivery decision, so a
 *     duplicate Porter webhook cannot restart the settlement clock on frozen money
 *   - orders with no held transfer fall back to post-delivery transfer creation
