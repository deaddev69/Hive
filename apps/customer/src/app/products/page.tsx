 * created: half of them - dresses, footwear, jeans, shirts - had no matching category in
 * production, so the schema handed search engines four URLs that answer 404. Nothing rendered
 * them as links, which is why it went unnoticed; only crawlers ever followed them.
 *
 * Reading the categories means the list cannot drift from what exists again. Every slug returned
 * here resolves, since it is the same table /products/[slug] resolves against.
