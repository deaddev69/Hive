  // OPTIMIZED_IMAGE_REQUEST_PAYMENT_REQUIRED) once the account's transformation quota was spent.
  // Already-cached renditions kept serving, so the failure was invisible on older images and hit
  // only those needing a fresh one: every newly uploaded content-engine banner and every newly
  // added static asset rendered broken in production. It was switched off entirely as a hotfix,
  // which restored the images but gave up per-width resizing.
  //
  // Cloudflare fronts both the R2 media bucket (cdn.hivenow.in) and this site, and already
  // performs the same work through /cdn-cgi/image/ — convex/media/urls.ts has been emitting such
  // URLs all along. Pointing next/image at it via the loader below restores responsive widths
  // with one optimizer in the path instead of two.

  // is what consults it. Retained so the settings above remain valid if this is ever reverted.
